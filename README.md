# rusty-note
A file in Rust that literally makes a wav file outputting sound.

# How to use

You could either clone this repository and build/run the rust program or download the sample.wav file. This file will produce a sine wave increasing in height in reference to the time it is being outputted, TLDR: crazy alien sounds.

Enjoy!
